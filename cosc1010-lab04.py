# The above two lists are datasets for the maximum and minimum temperatures for Laramie in 2023.
# Each of these lists has the same length, indicating that they both have the same index positions.
# Write a single for loop to calculate both the average maximum temperature and the average minimum temperature.
# You cannot use any pre-existing functions (like mean()) and must perform the calculations manually.
# Output the results of both calculations.

# Find the average temp

max_sum = 0 # create a variable to store the sum of all temps
for temp in max_temps: # Create a for loop that will iterate over all values in list 
    max_sum += temp # Add next value to the sum variable
max_average = max_sum / len(max_temps) # Divide the sum by the number of items in the list

print(f"the average max temp is {max_average}") # Print a message telling the user what the average temp is

#print(statistics.mean(max_temps)) I used mean to ensure that my loop works

# For the next part, determine the highest and lowest recorded temperatures.
# HINT: You can find this information without using any logic or looping.
